# Sophia - Average IQ voice bot
Sophia is a little smart voice bot who never wants to keep you silent. Although being more talkative than any normal bot should be (by changing self-speaking tolerance values), she is at the moment only good at replying to the user and playing specific songs which I don't consider uploading since some of them may be copyrighted (just avoiding risks).


# Modules used in the program include
1. os
2. datetime
3. time
4. playsound
5. speech_recognition
6. gtts
7. random
8. responses (user built module)


# Current state of Sophia
Although Sophia is at a good condition as of now... I still feel like I most defenitely have to get rid of the if-else barrage of statements. Also I am looking at different methods of fine tuning background noise cancellation. Moreover Sophia at the moment can only speak, but I intend to give more functionality to her and make her more legibly valuable. Also there are some modules that I haven't used yet! So make sure to keep in touch! :)
