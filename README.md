# Sophia - Average IQ voice bot
Sophia is a little smart voice bot who never wants to keep you silent. Although being more talkative than any normal bot should be (by changing self-speaking tolerance values), she is at the moment only good at replying to the user and playing specific songs which I don't consider uploading since some of them may be copyrighted (just avoiding risks).
